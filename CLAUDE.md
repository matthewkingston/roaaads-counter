# Newtownards Traffic Model — Project Overview

A gravity-model traffic assignment pipeline for Newtownards, calibrated against
walking count data and official AADT figures. The pipeline is fully reproducible:
running the scripts in order regenerates all outputs from raw data.

**Agent instruction:** Keep this file up to date. After any tuning run, count data
ingest, model change, or reference value update, edit the relevant sections before
committing. This file is the authoritative record of model state.

## Pipeline (run in this order)

```
python3 simulation/build_network.py          # build road network from OSM
python3 simulation/build_demographics.py     # node weights + map scaffold
python3 simulation/build_paths.py            # precompute all-pairs shortest paths (~10 min)

python3 analysis/ingest_counts.py            # process walking count CSVs → counts_processed.json
python3 analysis/aggregate_counts.py         # combine per-session AADT → link_aadt.json

python3 analysis/tune_assignment.py                        # Stage 1: tune gravity params (4 params, ~2 min)
python3 analysis/tune_assignment.py --full                 # Stage 2: + external zones (24 params, ~35 min)
python3 analysis/tune_assignment.py --note "description"   # optional human label in history

python3 simulation/build_assignment.py       # apply tuned params, write flows
python3 simulation/build_demographics.py --map-only   # rebuild map HTML only (fast)
```

After adding new count data, re-run from `ingest_counts.py` onward. The tuner
reads `simulation/tuned_params.json` as its starting point, so repeated runs
refine rather than restart.

## Key Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `simulation/build_demographics.py` | Downloads NISRA population, allocates to nodes, assigns external zone weights, builds map. `--map-only` skips demographic recomputation and rebuilds only the HTML. `--zones-only` patches boundary node weights without rebuilding. External zone pop/wp/damping values are read from `tuner_config.json` (lat/lon centroids remain hardcoded in the script). |
| `simulation/build_paths.py` | Precomputes all-pairs shortest paths; result cached in `newtownards_paths.npz`. Re-run if road network changes or `HIGHWAY_COST_FACTOR` values change. Edge costs are travel time × a road-class multiplier (trunk/primary: ×0.67, residential/unclassified/living_street: ×1.2, others: ×1.0) to bias routing toward major roads. Also reads `tuner_config.json` to filter which external→external OD pairs to include as through routes. |
| `simulation/build_assignment.py` | Gravity model + all-or-nothing assignment. Loads `tuned_params.json` automatically if present. Prints χ²/N goodness-of-fit table. |
| `simulation/edit_network.py` | Manual network edits (node deletions etc.). |
| `simulation/tuner_config.json` | **Tracked in git.** Reference values for L2 regularization, city→node groupings, `through_route_pairs` whitelist, and gravity param regularization. `lambda` regularises external zones; `gravity_lambda` + `gravity_ref` regularise P/ALPHA/W_BIZ toward physically plausible values (prevents K-drift pathology). Default P=300 s sets the peak travel time; ALPHA=2 gives 1/d² tail decay. Edit to change external zone priors, allowed through routes, or gravity anchors. |
| `analysis/ingest_counts.py` | Reads all CSVs from `data/counts/`, snaps GPS tracks to road links, estimates per-session AADT via hourly fraction profile. Idempotent: skips already-processed sessions. |
| `analysis/aggregate_counts.py` | Combines per-session AADT estimates into per-link estimates using inverse-variance weighting. Always regenerates from scratch. Output: `data/link_aadt.json`. |
| `analysis/tune_assignment.py` | Powell's method parameter tuning. Stage 1 tunes 4 gravity params; `--full` adds 14 city pop/wp + 6 dampings = 24 params total. Uses individual per-session observations from `link_aadt.json` (not per-link aggregates). Applies Woodbury correction for within-slot correlated uncertainty. Saves best result to `simulation/tuned_params.json` and appends to `simulation/tuning_history.jsonl`. Each run gets a unique random 8-char hex `id`; use `--note "label"` for a human-readable annotation. |
| `simulation/restore_params.py` | Restore `tuned_params.json` from any history entry by run ID. `--list` shows all runs; partial ID prefix matching is supported. |
| `simulation/reset_gravity_params.py` | Reset only the gravity params (K, W_BIZ, P, ALPHA) in `tuned_params.json` to the `gravity_ref` anchors in `tuner_config.json`. External zone params are preserved. |
| `data/counts/*.csv` | Raw walking count CSVs from the recorder app. Add new files and re-run `ingest_counts.py`. |
| `analysis/hourly_fractions.csv` | **Tracked in git.** NI-average hourly fraction profile (fraction of AADT per hour×day-of-week). Used for AADT estimation from short-duration counts. |

### Generated / gitignored outputs
`simulation/newtownards_paths.npz`, `simulation/node_weights.json`,
`simulation/newtownards_flows.json`, `simulation/newtownards_map.html`,
`simulation/tuned_params.json` — all regenerated by the pipeline.

### Tracked generated outputs
`data/counts_processed.json`, `data/link_aadt.json`,
`simulation/tuning_history.jsonl` — committed so history is preserved.
`simulation/tuner_config.json` — committed as source config (gitignore exception).
`analysis/hourly_fractions.csv` — committed as source data (single authoritative version).

### Large reference data (gitignored, kept locally only)
`data/*.ods`, `data/*.xlsx` — too large to commit; keep a local copy for reference.
Currently present: `data/2023-northern-ireland-traffic-count-data-in-ods-format.ods`
(the 3 AADT values already in use are hardcoded in `tune_assignment.py` — no
further data from this file is needed) and `data/census-2021-apwp001.xlsx`.

## Model Design

### Gravity model
OD flow: `T_ij = K × w_i × w_j × f(d_ij)`

Rational kernel: `f(d) = (ALPHA+1) × P^ALPHA × d / (ALPHA × P^(ALPHA+1) + d^(ALPHA+1))`

Equivalently (numerically stable): `u = d/P; f(d) = (ALPHA+1) × u / (ALPHA + u^(ALPHA+1))`

Properties: f(P) = 1 (peak always at d = P seconds), f(0) = 0, tail ~ 1/d^ALPHA for large d.

Node weight: `w = population + W_BIZ × business_demand`

Distances are least-time shortest paths (seconds), with an off-network leg added
for boundary nodes using their real-world centroid position.

### External zones
14 boundary nodes grouped into 7 cities in `tuner_config.json`. Each city shares
one pop and one wp value; individual nodes scale by a fixed damping ratio.
Nodes with damping=1.0 are fixed; nodes with damping<1.0 are tunable (but
L2-penalised toward the config reference values).

### Through routes
External→external OD pairs are included for a whitelisted set of city pairs
stored in `tuner_config.json` under `through_route_pairs`. All other
boundary→boundary pairs are excluded. The whitelist captures trips that genuinely
traverse Newtownards (e.g. Comber↔Donaghadee via A22→A48) while excluding trips
that use an out-of-network bypass (e.g. Belfast↔Bangor via the A2 coast road).
Changing the whitelist requires rebuilding the paths cache (`build_paths.py`).

Current whitelist: Comber↔Donaghadee, Comber↔LowerArds, Comber↔Millisle,
Comber↔Bangor, Bangor↔LowerArds, Belfast↔LowerArds.

### K: analytical calibration
At each optimizer evaluation, K is set analytically to minimise the Woodbury-corrected χ².
For unslotted (official) observations: standard weighted formula.
For each time slot s: Woodbury rank-1 correction removes the shared fractional mode.
The combined formula is: `K = B / A` where A and B accumulate both contributions.

### Goodness of fit
`χ²/N` (mean squared z-score, target ~1.0). Three official AADT sites (±10%) plus
all per-session walking-count observations from `link_aadt.json` observations lists.
Woodbury correction: observations sharing the same `(weekday, hour)` time slot have
correlated AADT uncertainty (same hourly fraction draw). The Woodbury matrix identity
on the rank-1 covariance removes this double-counting without cost.
`N_eff = N − N_slots` is printed as a diagnostic (each slot loses one effective df).

## Count Data

**Official AADT sites (fixed):**
- Site 507: A21 Bangor Road — 21,202 AADT
- Site 508: A48 Donaghadee Road — 10,792 AADT
- Site 444: A20 Portaferry Road — 7,282 AADT

**Walking counts:** 4 CSV files, 81 sessions, 159 individual session-direction observations across 107 directed links. The tuner uses per-session observations directly (not per-link aggregates); per-link aggregates are retained in `link_aadt.json` for reference.

## Tuning History

| 2026-06-14 | gravity | 15 | 4 | 5.72 | |

| 2026-06-14 | full | 25 | 24 | 0.98 | |
| 2026-06-14 | full | 25 | 24 | 0.90 | |
| 2026-06-14 | full | 62 | 24 | 0.956 | road-class routing, Hardford Link primary, excl 161→160 |
| 2026-06-15 | full | 62 | 24 | **0.895** | + through routes (6 city pairs); refs updated |
| 2026-06-15 | gravity | 109 | 4 | 2.346 | + 4th count session (107 directed links); per-link agg, no Woodbury |
| 2026-06-15 | gravity | 161 | 4 | 2.00 | Woodbury correction; per-session obs (N_eff=151, 10 slots) |
| 2026-06-15 | full | 161 | 24 | 1.1754 | Jeffreys v3 reprocess; paths cache stale (no through-routes) |
| 2026-06-15 | gravity | 161 | 4 | 1.1687 | rebuilt paths cache with through-routes (+56 OD pairs) |
| 2026-06-15 | full | 161 | 24 | 1.1207 | through-routes active; LowerArds resolved (+92% not +514%) |
| 2026-06-16 | gravity | 161 | 3 | 1.1565 | rational kernel (P/ALPHA replaces MU/SIGMA/ALPHA) |
| 2026-06-16 | full | 161 | 23 | **1.0833** | rational kernel full tune; P=190s, ALPHA=4.88 |

Current best full-tune: χ²/N = 1.0833 (161 obs, N_eff=151, 10 slots; rational kernel).
Official sites: 507 z=−1.38, 508 z=−0.46, 444 z=+0.50.
Persistent structural outliers: `719↔325` Messines Road (z=−4.36/−3.05), `328→326` Comber Road (z=−3.56), `18→21` Hardford Link (z=−3.15). All are internal-traffic corridors; external zone tuning cannot resolve them.
All cities tuning well above tuner_config refs (Donaghadee +184%, Belfast +284%, LowerArds +226%, Bangor +30%) — refs need updating before next run.
`22→159` (model=0) was a data error (snap direction bug, fixed 2026-06-15): now recorded as 159→22.
Belfast Road `20→18` zero-count obs gives z=−2.80 (obs=628, model=2,277) — persistent underprediction of internal Circular Road traffic.

### Paths cache note
The paths cache (`newtownards_paths.npz`) must be rebuilt with `build_paths.py` whenever
`through_route_pairs` changes. The cache previously lacked all through-routes despite the
whitelist being correct — the cache predated the through-route feature. This caused the
LowerArds pop to blow up to +514% as the tuner compensated for missing through-traffic.
After rebuilding (2026-06-15) LowerArds settled at +92%.

### Known model behaviour
- `W_BIZ` consistently converges to ~0: business demand adds no marginal fit
  improvement over residential population alone for this network and dataset.
- `K` is analytically set at each optimizer step to rescale the raw flow field to
  match observed AADT. It absorbs the overall scale of unnormalized gravity flows,
  which shifts by many orders of magnitude as ALPHA and P change (e.g. ALPHA 2→5
  changes the tail by ~10^9 for a typical d=1000s path). The degeneracy is
  between K and the gravity parameters, not K and the external zone populations
  (which only vary O(100%) under L2 regularization and can only contribute O(4×)
  to raw flows). χ²/N is reliable; K is not interpretable in isolation.
- After a structural model change (e.g. adding through routes or new count data), a gravity-only
  stage 1 run with fixed external zone weights will show inflated χ²/N and
  spurious outliers at boundary sites (esp. site 508). A full 24-param re-tune
  is needed to restore fit quality.
- **Snap direction bug (fixed 2026-06-15):** `ingest_counts.py` stored canonical
  `(min(u,v), max(u,v))` indices in `edge_geoms` instead of the actual directed
  `(u, v)`. For one-way roads where u > v (e.g. 159→22), the dot-product sign was
  correct but `link_with` was flipped. Fix: store `(u, v)` not `(pair[0], pair[1])`.
  Only `f56b2ce4` was materially affected — re-snapped from 22→159 to 159→22.
- The Woodbury correction accounts for within-slot correlated uncertainty: all observations
  in the same `(weekday, hour)` slot share the same NI-average hourly fraction, so their
  fractional AADT uncertainty is perfectly correlated. The correction is O(B_slot) per slot
  (negligible cost). `N_eff = N − N_slots` is the effective degrees of freedom after removing
  one per slot. The 10 current slots yield N_eff=151 vs N=161.

## External Zone Reference Values (`tuner_config.json`)

Updated after 2026-06-15 full tuning run (χ²/N=0.895). Always update these
after a full tuning run to keep regularization centred on the current best estimate.
